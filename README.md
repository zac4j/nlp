This repository stores the notebooks of the Kaggle NLP competitions I participated in before.

The competitions are:

## BBC News Classification

[Home](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc) | [Notebook](https://github.com/zac4j/nlp/blob/main/bbc-news-classification.ipynb)

### Description

Text documents are one of the richest sources of data for businesses.

We’ll use a public dataset from the BBC comprised of 2225 articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech.

The dataset is broken into 1490 records for training and 735 for testing. The goal will be to build a system that can accurately classify previously unseen news articles into the right category.

The competition is evaluated using Accuracy as a metric.

Following blog has good information on how to look at the problem. https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/problem-solving-with-ml-automatic-document-classification



##  Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

[Home](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started) | [Notebook](https://github.com/zac4j/nlp/blob/main/disaster_tweets_classification.ipynb)

### Description

This particular challenge is perfect for data scientists looking to get started with Natural Language Processing. The competition dataset is not too big, and even if you don’t have much personal computing power, you can do all of the work in our free, no-setup, Jupyter Notebooks environment called Kaggle Notebooks.
